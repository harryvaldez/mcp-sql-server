# MCP SQL Server

Remote FastMCP server for dual SQL Server 2019 instances with strong read-only controls, rate limiting, and diagnostics.

## What This Repository Provides

- FastMCP + FastAPI service exposing SQL tools over HTTP at /mcp
- Dual-instance SQL Server 2019 support (primary and secondary)
- Read-only SQL policy controls with denylist (13 patterns: DDL, DML, DCL, system procedures) and allowlist config
- Redis or local rate limiting with per-actor and global limits
- Security-oriented output handling (sensitive field redaction)
- Diagnostics endpoints for runtime posture and tool usage
- Docker runtime and compose files for local and remote operation

- config: instance config, policy, and rate-limit settings
- policy: SQL allowlist and denylist definitions
- docker: Dockerfile and compose files
- tests: unit tests
- testing: integration and operational test harnesses
- docs: tool catalog, runbooks, and run instructions
- docs/runbooks/scaling-strategy.md: runbook for scaling and load-validation operations

## Quick Start (Local)

1. Create and activate a Python 3.11+ virtual environment.
2. Install dependencies:

Windows (PowerShell):

```powershell
pip install -e .[dev]
```

Linux/macOS:

```bash
pip install -e '.[dev]'
```

3. Copy environment and config templates:

Windows (PowerShell):

```powershell
Copy-Item .env.example .env
```

Linux/macOS:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

4. Configure instances in `config/instances.yaml` (this repository already includes it; no `instances.yaml.example` file is provided). For parity with the `.env.example` -> `.env` pattern above, use the existing file as your local runtime file and use `config/instances.runtime.example.yaml` as the format/key reference.
5. Run the service:

```powershell
python -m src.server
```

6. Validate endpoints:

- http://localhost:8080/
- http://localhost:8080/diagnostics/health
- http://localhost:8080/diagnostics/security
- http://localhost:8080/diagnostics/pool

Primary rollout verification checks:

- `/diagnostics/health`: confirms service and instance connectivity.
- `/diagnostics/security`: confirms auth mode, required scope count, group-authorization posture, and registered tool inventory.
- `/diagnostics/pool`: confirms per-instance SQL pool sizing and reuse counters.

## Docker Runtime

Use the runtime compose flow documented in docs/run-mcp-server-with-docker.md.

Controlled-write policy is enforced from config/runtime-policy.yaml. The file policy/sql-allowlist.yaml is a review/reference mirror and is not loaded as a runtime policy source.

```powershell
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.runtime.yml up -d
```

## Operational Runbooks

- [Scaling strategy](docs/runbooks/scaling-strategy.md) - guidance for dashboard scaling and load validation.
- [Security maintenance](docs/runbooks/security-maintenance.md) - maintenance checks for security posture and operational hygiene.

## Testing

Run unit tests:

```powershell
pytest -q
```

Current validation snapshot:

- Full test suite: `196 passed`
- See [docs/release-notes-v1.4.0.md](docs/release-notes-v1.4.0.md) for the latest release details.

## Security Notes

- Do not commit real secrets.
- Keep .env local only.
- Prefer least-privilege SQL credentials.
- See SECURITY.md for reporting and hardening guidance.

## Contributing

See CONTRIBUTING.md for branch, PR, and test expectations.

## Release and CI

- CI runs on pull requests and pushes to master/main.
- Release tags follow v* (example: v1.2).
- Latest release notes: [docs/release-notes-v1.4.0.md](docs/release-notes-v1.4.0.md)

## CMMI-Oriented Platform Integration

This repository includes GitHub-native process controls aligned to CMMI implementation patterns:

- Requirements management: requirement issue template and PR traceability sections
- Configuration management: branch protection, CODEOWNERS, signed commits, and protected release tags
- Verification and validation: CI checks, PR gates, and traceability check workflow
- Measurement and analysis: scheduled traceability matrix generation
- Audit trail: issue/PR history, commit history, and workflow logs retained in GitHub

Artifacts:

- .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/requirement.yml
- .github/workflows/traceability-check.yml
- .github/workflows/traceability-matrix.yml
- docs/traceability-matrix.md
